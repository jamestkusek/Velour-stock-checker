# Velour-stock-checker
"check the stock of my fav garms"

a simple html page that scrapes data from  "https://velourgarments.eu/products.json", 

This is my first real attempt at a "programming" project, I undertook this
short project to introduce myself to webscraping, but also ended learning about dynamic webpage design aswell.

There are many more improvements I could make to this webpage, but I have added all the
functional features I wanted with my knowledge and skillset. The look of the page leaves
something to be desired but I didn't feel like tidying it up, visual design wasn't the main
focus of this project.

This webpage shows a list of all products from https://velourgarments.eu
To acheive this a script reads the (shopify) store's JSON file and generates a list of available stock. 
This webpage supports window resizing, filtering and sorting of stock, and displays which sizes of each item are 
out of stock/available to buy.

The code is messy and inefficient, something I will rectify to the best of my ability later.
